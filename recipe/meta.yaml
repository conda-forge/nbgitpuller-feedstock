    # pyproject.toml doesn't seem to be respected, due to this, we need to
    # explicitly make our build dependency jupyter-packaging available. This
    # could be resolved also by wrapping the setup.py's use of jupyter-packaging
    # within a try/catch block.
    #
    # See https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/3507 and
    # https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-packaging#as-a-build-requirement for
    # more relevant details.
